post-submission comment: this space would have been for the top navigation bar that was 
present in the mobile design mockup. I planned to pull some assets from Material-UI to help
with the menu and search icons. The cart and item counter would probably be reading from a
store or be fetching from a backend that would keep info about a user's session.
